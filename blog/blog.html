				 I don't use much web based form so the closest one I use is the Southwest Airlines website. I think the website does a good job of hierachy. The website makes booking a flight is the main content because this is what people usually go to the website for. The website also made the departure, arrival, depart/return date in big text which shows well thought out hiearchy. I think the interface also does a good job with clarity. The words are big and clear and the color is minimal so that it is clear for the user to read and use. The blue text against the white background helps pop out the content of the page. Lastly, I think the website does a good job of maintaining its purpose which is a platform to book flights, hotels, and cars, as well as checking in our their flight status.

				<p>A userface that I use every day is an app called MacroPlus. As a fitness/ health fanatic, nutrition is important for my goals so tracking my daily macronutrient intake is crucial. After using several food tracking apps, I found MacroPlus to be the most user friendly for someone like me who follows a flexible dieting lifestlye. Someone who follows a flexibile dieting lifestlye can eat anything as long as it hits the daily carb, protein, fat intakes. Something I found very useful of how the app is designed is how they put the remaining amounts of macronutrients at the top; this really helps users think what they are allowed to eat that still fits whithin their remaining macros. </p>

				<p> At the end of each meal, the app also shows what the amount of macronutrients are for each meal so that users can better allocate macros throughout the day. Users can easily change the amount of grams for each food as well as edit any items that may be wrong with just a click of a button. </p>

				<p> Another design I really appreciate about the app is how they thought about the users who will use this app and made sure they put an option in of different macro goals. Macro goals are constantly changing each week so it is easy for users to make a goal and change the total macronutrients for each day. </p>

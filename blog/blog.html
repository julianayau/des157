			<h2> BLOG 1 </h2>
      <p>A userface that I use every day is an app called MacroPlus. As a fitness/ health fanatic, nutrition is important for my goals so tracking my daily macronutrient intake is crucial. After using several food tracking apps, I found MacroPlus to be the most user friendly for someone like me who follows a flexible dieting lifestlye. Someone who follows a flexibile dieting lifestlye can eat anything as long as it hits the daily carb, protein, fat intakes. Something I found very useful of how the app is designed is how they put the remaining amounts of macronutrients at the top; this really helps users think what they are allowed to eat that still fits whithin their remaining macros. </p>

      <p> At the end of each meal, the app also shows what the amount of macronutrients are for each meal so that users can better allocate macros throughout the day. Users can easily change the amount of grams for each food as well as edit any items that may be wrong with just a click of a button. </p>

      <p> Another design I really appreciate about the app is how they thought about the users who will use this app and made sure they put an option in of different macro goals. Macro goals are constantly changing each week so it is easy for users to make a goal and change the total macronutrients for each day. </p>

		<h2> BLOG 6 </h2>
		<p>
			In Chapter 12, Steve Krug talks about the importance of web accessibility. It is web designer’s as well as developers responsibility to take accessibility into consideration when building a website. There are a lot of arguments about why designers should take accessibility into consideration but Krug states that there is only one reason why it’s important: it’s just the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do because accessibility just makes people’s lives better as well as it gives designers an opportunity to improve people’s lives. However, when considering accessibility, there are two fears that developers and designers have. These two fears are: more work and compromised design. It is more work on the developers end and designers are scared that they will be forced to design a website that is less appealing.
	Krug continues to say that accessibility can be complicated but he offers four things that a designer can do. The first one is to fix the usability problem that confuses everyone. Designers think that if they make sites more accessible for the general population, then it will make it more usable for people. But it is actually the opposite. If we design sites to be usable for disable people, then it is the site will be more effective for the general population. Krug suggests the best thing to improve a site’s accessibility is to test it often and continually fix the parts that confuses people.
	The next suggestion Krgu suggests is to read an article. He recommends to read the article “Guidelines for Accessible and Usable Web Sites: Observing Users Who Work with Screen Readers”. The article essentially talks about how blind users are just as similar to sighted users. They are impatient and want to get their information as fast as possible.
	The third suggestion is to read two books called A Web for Everyone: Designing Accessible User Experiences by Sara Horton and Web accessibility: Web Standards and Regularity Compliance by Jim Thatcher. These books just talk about web accessibility.
	Lastly, Krug suggests implementing specific changes to web pages. These include, using alt tags to every image, using headings correctly, making forms work with screen readers, put a “skip to main content” link at the beginning of each page, make all content accessible by keyboard, create significant contrast between text and background, and finally use an accessible template.

			For studio 4, I used Leaflet to create a map. I learned the different functions used to make the map. I think the library is really useful to make maps. However, I didn't like how I had to use mapbox to create a map. I thought that I could create a map just using leaflet. <br />

		<h2> BLOG 4 </h2>
		<p>
			For studio 4, I wanted to make an interactive Valentine's Day joke page. I used a settimer() so that whenever the user hovers over, the heart, the question of the joke appears. Then, when the user clicks on the heart, the heart opens to reveal the punch line of the joke. Also, I used setInterval() to make a pixel heart appear in different places to make the user feel like confetti pops out when the open the heart.

			For studio 3, I decided to do the project on my collection of cereal. I wanted to make it seem like people were buying cereal online and getting a review of each cerea. To do this, I wanted to make sure there was interaction between the visuals and the
			user. My first solution to this was having the cereal boxes shake when the user hovers over the boxes. By doing this, I was hoping this will create the sense of when we tend to shake boxes because we wonder what's inside. My next interaction was to
			have the cereal boxes open when the user clicks on the box. And finally, my last interaction is my the cereal review message popping up when the user clicks on the box. By doing this, I hope this creates a little sense of excitment and surprise for
			the user.

			I don't use much web based form so the closest one I use is the Southwest Airlines website. I think the website does a good job of hierachy. The website makes booking a flight is the main content because this is what people usually go to the website for.
			The website also made the departure, arrival, depart/return date in big text which shows well thought out hiearchy. I think the interface also does a good job with clarity. The words are big and clear and the color is minimal so that it is clear for
			the user to read and use. The blue text against the white background helps pop out the content of the page. Lastly, I think the website does a good job of maintaining its purpose which is a platform to book flights, hotels, and cars, as well as checking
			in our their flight status.

		<p>A userface that I use every day is an app called MacroPlus. As a fitness/ health fanatic, nutrition is important for my goals so tracking my daily macronutrient intake is crucial. After using several food tracking apps, I found MacroPlus to be the most
			user friendly for someone like me who follows a flexible dieting lifestlye. Someone who follows a flexibile dieting lifestlye can eat anything as long as it hits the daily carb, protein, fat intakes. Something I found very useful of how the app is
			designed is how they put the remaining amounts of macronutrients at the top; this really helps users think what they are allowed to eat that still fits whithin their remaining macros. </p>

		<p> At the end of each meal, the app also shows what the amount of macronutrients are for each meal so that users can better allocate macros throughout the day. Users can easily change the amount of grams for each food as well as edit any items that may
			be wrong with just a click of a button. </p>

		<p> Another design I really appreciate about the app is how they thought about the users who will use this app and made sure they put an option in of different macro goals. Macro goals are constantly changing each week so it is easy for users to make a
			goal and change the total macronutrients for each day. </p>

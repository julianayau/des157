		<p>
			In the first round of prototyping, my partner and I didn't know we weren't supposed to talk so we accidentally went through the whole process telling the person what to do. But I discovered that for the second round, I should actually make the drop down options for when the person clicks on the button.
			For the second round, I learned that the user was confused whether they were filling out their own personal information or they were filling out information for a coach they were looking for. Knowing this, I will have to make sure to be clear about indicating what information the user is entering in.

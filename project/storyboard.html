		<h2> Storyboard 1 </h2>
		<p>
			In my first storyboard, I drew an over-weight person who looked in the mirror and decided to wanted to make some health changes but don't know how to get started. He still wants to have his pizza but still make progress but is also not sure on how to do that. So he decides a need a coach, but also a coach that fits his personal lifestlye of eating. He goes on the CoachFit website, answers some questions and is matched with a coach that fits his lifestyle.

		<h2> Storyboard 2</h2>
		<p>
			I got some feedback from my first storyboard about how I may not be targeting the right audience. So my next storyboard, I decided to target someone who is a bodybuilder who is trying to find an appropriate coach to help reach his goals. His specific goals are reverse dieting and winning his competition. He goes on the CoachFit website, answers some questions and is matched with the perfect coach to help acheive his goals.

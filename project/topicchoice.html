    <h2> Topic Choice </h2>
      <article> My choice of topic is to create a website that helps bodybuilders or people who are trying to get in shape find a coach that is suitable for them. Through my own personal experience, I have encountered coaches who do not have the same beliefs as the client or works well with the client. By creating this website/ app, this could help ease trying to find the right fit for a coach. I am thinking of having a search engine where the user can click on different options based on their preferences and the results will then show coaches that best match their interests. Also, each coach would have to sign up and create a profile that will include information about their approach to fitness as well as social media and contact information.
